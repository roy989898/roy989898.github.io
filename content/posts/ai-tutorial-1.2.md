| Term  | Meaning |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Term | Meaning
|Label | The data that we're trying to predict, such as "dog" or "cat"
|Architecture | The _template_ of the model that we're trying to fit; the actual mathematical function that we're passing the input data and parameters to
|Model | The combination of the architecture with a particular set of parameters
|Parameters | The values in the model that change what task it can do, and are updated through model training
|Fit | Update the parameters of the model such that the predictions of the model using the input data match the target labels
|Train | A synonym for _fit_
|Pretrained model | A model that has already been trained, generally using a large dataset, and will be fine-tuned
|Fine-tune | Update a pretrained model for a different task
|Epoch | One complete pass through the input data
|Loss | A measure of how good the model is, chosen to drive training via SGD
|Metric | A measurement of how good the model is, using the validation set, chosen for human consumption
|Validation set | A set of data held out from training, used only for measuring how good the model is
|Training set | The data used for fitting the model; does not include any data from the validation set
|Overfitting | Training a model in such a way that it _remembers_ specific features of the input data, rather than generalizing well to data not seen during training
|CNN | Convolutional neural network; a type of neural network that works particularly well for computer vision tasks
